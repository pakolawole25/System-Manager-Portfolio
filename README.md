## üìå Featured Projects

## Cybersecurity Capstone Projects (Darey.io):

Project 1: Malicious Network Traffic Analysis via Wireshark
Project Overview:
Investigated a simulated malware infection through network traffic analysis in Wireshark. Identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), reconstructed the infection chain, and produced a professional incident response report following SOC protocols. Demonstrated proficiency in traffic analysis, threat hunting, and malware behavior profiling.
