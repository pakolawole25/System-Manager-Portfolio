# Project 2: Cyber-Resilient Network Design with Cisco Packet Tracer

## Executive Summary
Designed a secure, segmented, and resilient enterprise network architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer for a fictional company. This project emphasized applying best practices for network security through VLANs, ACLs, Layer 2/3 hardening, and wireless network segmentation. I simulated logging and monitoring features to ensure readiness for compliance audits and cyber threats.

## Project Overview
- Designed VLAN-segmented network across departments.
- Implemented ACLs to enforce access restrictions between VLANs.
- Configured Layer 2 security features (Port Security, DAI, BPDU Guard, etc.).
- Hardened devices with secure management and access policies (SSH, banners, etc.).
- Deployed secure Wi-Fi architecture for corporate and guest networks.
