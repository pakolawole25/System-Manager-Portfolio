# Project 4: Advanced Phishing Attack Incident Response

## Executive Summary
Led a simulated incident response engagement for a multi-stage phishing attack impacting users across different regions. Leveraged incident response best practices aligned with the NIST framework to identify the scope, analyze EDR logs, email filtering failures, and produce a detailed technical report with containment, eradication, and recovery strategies.

## Project Overview
- Conducted phishing campaign analysis across scattered systems.
- Analyzed helpdesk tickets, email headers, EDR alerts for root cause.
- Mapped IOC timeline across impacted users and systems.
- Developed NIST-aligned incident response lifecycle documentation.
- Provided recommendations to strengthen security posture and policies.
