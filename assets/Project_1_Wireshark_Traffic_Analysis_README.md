# Project 1: Wireshark Traffic Analysis - Malicious Download Investigation

## Executive Summary
This project involved a hands-on simulation of investigating a suspected malware infection through network traffic analysis. Using Wireshark, I analyzed packet captures (PCAP files) from an infected endpoint, identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), reconstructed the infection chain, and documented findings in a professional incident response report. This exercise strengthened my practical skills in SOC processes, network forensics, and threat intelligence correlation.

## Project Overview
- Investigated malicious network traffic using Wireshark.
- Identified infected host details (IP, MAC, Hostname, User).
- Reconstructed infection chain tied to a phishing site and malware download.
- Produced IOCs: domains, IPs, file hashes, URLs, and anomalies.
- Documented findings following professional incident response standards (Executive Summary, Timeline, Analysis, Mitigation).
